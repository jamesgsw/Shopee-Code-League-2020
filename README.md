# Shopee-Code-League-2020
This hackathon was organised by Shopee for a period of 8 weeks. The hackathon was organised with a new challenge every week with topics including  Data Analysis, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Image Recognition and Natural Language Processing. [Link](https://careers.shopee.sg/codeleague/) to the hackathon page.

My team and I took part in all of the 6/8 challenges over the period and manage to attain a ranking of top 15%.

This repository contains some of my work on these 8 challenges. Due to the breadth of topics covered, there were some challenges hosted on platform by Shopee that I did not save into my local file system, therefore, this repository does not contain the entire journey.

The list of challenges are:
<ol>
  <li> Order Brushing(Data Analytics) </li>
  <li> Product Detection(Did not participate) </li>
  <li> Algorithm Contest #01 </li>
  <li> Title Translation(Did not participate) </li>
  <li> Logistic Analytics </li>
  <li> Sentiment Analysis </li>
  <li> Algorithm Contest #02 </li>

</ol>
